CSCI 4176 - Assignment 2 - Sudoku Application

Task:

Implement an Android application that implements the Sudoku puzzle. The application should be a native Android application. The application should meet the following minimum requirements:

* The interface should allow the user to start and reset the puzzle. (You may hard code in a single puzzle to start with, create a small database of puzzles, or if you are ambitious, grab new puzzles at runtime from various websites, or even generate your own.)
* The interface should display the Sudoku grid and allow the player to fill elements with valid values. I.e., if the player tries to fill an element with a digit that is used, the app should not allow it.
* The interface should inform the player once they have solved or lost the puzzleâ€”when no elements can be filled.

Naturally, you may choose to improve on this interface. For example, items like background, sound effects, sound-tracks, suggestions, and animations add polish to the application and make it even cooler. Marks will be awarded partly on how polished the application is.

For exceptional functionality consider implementing 
  * a timing option to time how long the player takes to solve the puzzle, 
  * a best times list, 
  * provide new puzzles for the player to solve, 
  * an undo/redo function to let the player undo a number of elements, 
  * suggest possible hints to the player, 
  * anything else you can think of that makes the game cooler. The list is endless.
